Name of QuantLet : LM_JumpTest_2008

Published in : 'To be published in METIS'

Description : 'R port of Python code to test whether a jump in a high frequency time series has happened by the methodology of Lee & Mykland (2008). In general, usage of this test is discouraged for high frequency datasets, e.g. tick data, as it is not rebust to microstructure noise. See Lee / Mykland (2012) and Ait-Sahalia / Jacod (2012) for methodologies that are robust to microstructure noise.'

Keywords : Jumps, jump test, high frequency, time series, Lee, Mykland, stochastic processes, cryptocurrencies, crypto
